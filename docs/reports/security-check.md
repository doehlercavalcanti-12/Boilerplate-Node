# Security Validation Report

- **Command:** `npm run security:owasp`
- **Summary:** Combined linting, unit tests, Playwright tests, and Docker build to validate OWASP client-side safeguards.

| Step | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | ✅ Passed | ESLint security rules enforced without violations. |
| `npm run test` | ✅ Passed | Unit tests and coverage thresholds satisfied. |
| `npm run playwright` | ✅ Passed | Playwright regression suite succeeded. |
| `npm run docker:build` | ⚠️ Skipped | Docker CLI unavailable in CI environment (`docker: not found`). |

> ⚠️ **Action:** Docker build could not be validated locally; rerun `npm run docker:build` in an environment with Docker installed to complete verification.
